%%This function is added to align spikes into their trough before feeding the ASR algorithm.
%%hp.MAIa is the interval for looking toward a local minima after the
%%current spike time onset
%%hp.MAIb is the interval for looking toward a local minima before the
%%current spike time onset
% the miss-aligned spike onsets will be saved in a cell structure,
% named"in.Spike_cell_missaligned", with the same data format as
% in.Spike_cell.
